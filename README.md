This is a simple URL shortener built using Node.js without any external frameworks. It allows users to enter a long URL and generate a shorter version using either a custom short code or a randomly generated one. When someone visits the shortened link, the server redirects them to the original URL. The backend uses core Node.js modules like `http`, `fs`, `path`, and `crypto`, and stores all link mappings in a `links.json` file inside the `data` folder. The frontend is served using a basic HTML page (`index.html`) and optionally styled with a CSS file (`style.css`). The server listens on port 3000, and when it starts, users can access the service at `http://localhost:3000`. It also features an endpoint (`/links`) to fetch all the stored short links and displays the three most recent ones on the page. The project is great for learning basic backend concepts such as HTTP methods, routing, file I/O, and handling form data with vanilla JavaScript and Node.js.
